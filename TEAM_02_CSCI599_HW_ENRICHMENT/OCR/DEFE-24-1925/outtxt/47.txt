OR HOAX?

 

My attention was ﬁrst drawn to these
strange circles when a set of ﬁve, one
targe surrounded by four smatter ones,
appeared in a wheatﬁeld at Patching.
Sussex. They appeared some time
between 10pm on 28 June and dawn on 29
June 1985. The central and largest of the
circles measured some 50ft in diameter
and thefoursmatter enes15ftin diameter.
The wheat had been neatly flattened
by a swirling motion in a ctockwise
direction. ,
‘ ~ The circles were a reasonable distance

. from the road and. at the time they were

discovered, there was no trace of any of
the surrounding crop having been ﬂat-

tened as it would have been if anyone had

watked into the ﬂetd to setect the site. For

_ this reason it was suggested that the

marks . would have to be made by
something tending on the spot. My initial
enquiries reveaied that most peopte were
of'the opinion that a UFO was responsi-

‘ 'ble. Obviously there were those who

preferred to dismiss it as a hoax, atthough
they have not provided a suitable
explanation as to how this could be done

‘ without damaging the surrounding crop-

reported to me on 26 June by‘ Wayne

Lewis who, aiong with his brothet Ricky
and three friends, had seen what they

described as a yeitowy white light moving

in the direction of Clapham, which‘is but a
short distance from Patching.

For approximately ten minutes the
object hovered over ,Clapham‘ Wood
where the tight became more intense and
began pulsating, After this it took off ‘at a
reasonbly high speed and was lost from
sight within a matte: of seconds.

Atthough there were no UFO sightings
on the actua) evening that the circles

appeared '—- at least as far as t am aware —- it '

is interesting to hate that there does

always seem to be a UFO sighting
reported within a few days, and at the
most a week, before the ctrctes appear.

The very same weekend ﬁve circles,
simitar in dimension to those at Patching,
appeared in a wheatfie!d alongside the B

3093 at Bratton. Wiltshire. This is not the

first time that such circles have appeared
in this area. In Juty 1983 their appearance
made the national news mainly because
of Bratton‘s close proximity to Warmins-

ter, which became famous in the mid '

19605 for the number of UFO sightings

Throughout Juty 1985 the circles
appeared in Hampshire and Wiltshire. in
