to my satisfaction how light-
houses manage to ﬂy in a
blaze of lights nor how rab~
bits give off radiation.

The three authors have
also produced some fascinat-
ing supplementary evidence

and Ralph Noyes, former
head of the MOD department
responsbile for RAF intelli-
gence, said in a statement:
“We now have evidence ~- I
blush to say about my own
Ministry ~— that they have
lied about this case. They
have covered it up.”

Conspiracy

And so the conspiracy of
silehce continues, though
these rlexermined ladies have
no intention of giving up
their pursuit of the truth.

Their book raises some
questions about
the USAF bases in East An-
glia in view of Mrs Thatch;
er’s decision to allow them
to be used by F—lll bombers
for the attack on Libya,

Quite clearly we have little
control over the bases and,
when something untoward
occurs, lose no time in help
ing the US cover it up.

l do not believe that the
UFO which disturbed the
Suffolk woodland on that
wintry night carried some
spooky visitors from a dis-

No; {he explanation ls

spacecraﬁ which had been
on an illegal mission in
outer space years ahead of
President Reagan’s beloved
Star Wars programme.

my hobby horse. Bring

Service for the army of unemployed
youngsiers aimlessly wandering
our streets.

Oh. I know all about freedom of
the individual and suchlike. but can
any of us who did our stint in
uniform honestly say we did not
thoroughly enjoy it?

I will not inﬂict you wiih such
rubbish as: "It will make men of

My experience in the Army was
that it did neither. More important,
it showed us how people from all
parts of the country. of all classes,
colours and religions, could live in
harmony. It also gave us a chance
to see the world beyond these
shores, and taught us how to look
aﬁer ourselves.

X hope the spirit of those times
will be captured in an exhibition on
National Service, opening at the
Imperial War Museum in London
next September. Altogether some
250,000 of us were conscripted be‘

What a laugh it all was. My post-

with the same impression. ,

Patrick Moore, from Bromsgrove,

would not agree. He was a regular
soldier who served 14 years, and
reckons Naiional Service was a
waste of time, money, manpower
and lives.

He writes: “Young men around 18
were plucked from their jobs,
homes and loved ones, put into
ugly, ill~ﬁtting uniforms that made
them resemble walking coal sacks,
and dispatched m a variety of inter-
national destinations."

Well, you could say that. How-
ever, the youngsters I am talking
about have no jobs to be plucked
from. And that is the most dreadful
wash: of all.
