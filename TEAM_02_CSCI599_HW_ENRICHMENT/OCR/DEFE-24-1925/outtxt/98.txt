REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ABOUT AIRCRAFT MGVEMENTS

I ﬁave received your letter of 2 October in which you pose a variety of
questions about aircraft movements in North Yorkshire. Unfortunately we
do not have the infonmation you require. Eowever, I have invited our
air tzaff is people to ﬁre at your infarmation and queries in the same
manner as any from the puhl ic concerning 10¥.t flying aircrafb.

Having done this, I cannot promiae any outcome. I also suggest that since
we are but a small unit with a very limiteﬁ complimemt of aircraft you mav
wish to consider alternative avenues 0f enquiry.
