According to this information supplied by the YORK
Astronomical Society Halley's Comet is or was on the
co—odinatee given above seen near ALDEEBARAN . In the
Vicinity of the comet are star groups of ORION and RIGEL.
It is at the moment not olear.from this map where the

comet is to appear next. Hopefully it is heading for ORION
so at any case, keep watwhing. If anyone out there oan send
us a plot chart showing where we should look for it.That
would be most helpful. Editor. Thanks to Martin Dawson

and for ALGOL, which contained the above information.

1985 which we received on the day I typed this, May 9,

is this interesting bit on Halley‘s Comet by Roger

C. Moldander called: ONLY 14 MILLION YEARS UNTIL
DOQMSLAY. (Thanks Gene this came just in time for this
article): =note due to ‘1ength,_we have shortened it).
”Halley's Comet appeared in 1066, on the eve of the
Norman invasion of England. It cuts a striking figure

in a contemporary tapestry woven to celebrate the cone
quest, altogether more moving than our 1910 photogra h

of its last visit (article about comets in general

years time~we.may.find ourselvss similarly transfixed;
Not, mind you, by Bailey's comet. This ”friendly” Visitor
has been tracked since 24OBC., we enlightened moderns have
ho reason to fear it. But scientists have recently made a
case for periodic cycles, rf perhaps a million years each,
in which a billion—odd comets fla-eh through the solar sys—
tem, with odd of two dozen direct hits on the Earth, throwing
enough inst into the upper atmOSphere -to block out the sun
and thus destroying life forms on the surface. Sounds fam—
iliar? Like the nuclear winter we could bring on ourselves.
But turn away from the doomsday cloqk now set by atomic
scientists at four minutes to midnight. The Doomsday clock
has been set forward, from 5 billion years to 14 million,
not by any human malice or intent. The cause is uncertain,

The binary star theory is more aesthet1ca11y eatidfying-
the death star is called Nemesis after the Greek. goddess who
persecutes the "excesaiviy rich, proud, and powerful " The
dinosaurs are the best known ruling class to fall victim to
such persecution, and they disappeared in relatively short
order 65 million years ago. The clasSical Overlay works well
if you remember that the Latin roots of our word ‘dieaeter"
are "evil star." Whatever the cause, the effects are enorm—
ous. Imagine a million years in which all eyes on Earth turm
tOWards the heavens, where perhaps a billion ﬁdirty snowballs"
are flashing by. Quite a show, until the most disasterous
of the likely two dozen direct hits.

The ancients may yet be right in making comets a portent
of disaster in the affairs of men. But we Will kill the Earth

of the cosmos and Our place in it. It seems that we might
