 

UNUSUAL OCCURRENCE (UFO?)

 

who farms near the AAC Centre, Middle Wallop telephoned to report some
extraordinary depressions in a field of near ripe wheat, and asked, "What on

earﬁh we (THE AAC) were up to now?" I took the Aircraft Actident Inveatigation
Officer (AIFSO) Maj RENE with me and went to inﬁpecﬁ the sceneg

W’ .
2. The site, Gr . *~*e*~"ce 336392 was a vergin, unuweather damaged, near ripe
field of wheat. We found the fallawing:

   
   

a. An exactly circular hole in ﬁhﬁ wheat in which the wheat had bean

laid flat in a clockwise iwist £0 ft in diameter. {A3 if a plank had
been put with one end at the centre and then swapt round in a complete
circle). There were one or two gtalks of wheat Standing which had sprung
upright again. The whaat on the edge of the circle was completely upright
anﬂ undamaged.

b. Four separate, amaller circles apprcx twelve feet in diameter, exactly
similar to the largér one. Thase were set in a precisa square, NORTH/SOUTH
and EAST/WEST, with their centres #3 paces from the centre of the large circle.

c. Thera ware absslutely no tracks in the wheat. To have Set the holes
in such a pracisa patcern manually would haV$ raquired a tape measure or
string, and the users wauld have been bound to leaua tratks in the wheat.

d. All but one of the holes touched Gnﬁo the main furraws in the wheat,
and could tharefore be appraached_fram the edge of the field without leaving
tracks. However thare was no way of waving from one to the other wihhout
leaving tracks in the wheat: except by going same 200 yards to the edge of
the field, and then back down anathar main furrow. One 6f the smaller
