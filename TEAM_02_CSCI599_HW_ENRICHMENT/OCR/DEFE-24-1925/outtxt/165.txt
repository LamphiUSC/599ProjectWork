 

CONCLU'STON AND
OUR POLICY ON UFOs

Cosmology Newslink's policy on
unidentified flying objects is based
on the statements and article seen
on pages 4 3c 5, also on our own
inv-stignions into them. Our poticy
is now as follows:-

‘We wouldvel-ike ito ‘

belieVe that, UFOs
exiSt; so we hope to

find evidence, in some

form other than .photogrhphic
and present an overall picture

on them in general.

We hope not to give up
the long walk do am an eadless road
in sheer frustration, but continue to
seek for answers until we can teach
the satisfactory conclusion that the
whole world has for centuries been
waiting for.
