RAF MOODBRIDGE INCIDENT 27 Deﬁ 80

Col Halt‘s report of 13 Jan 81 concerns the sighting of
unusual lights outside the back gate at RAF Woodbridge by two
security patrolmen. Col Halt records what was subsequently reported
to him without comment. The 3 patrolman who went intc Rendlesham
Forest to investigate what they £hought might be a crashed aircraft
say they saw a triangular object. It has been suggested that this
might have been a piloted vehicle, however in view of its reported
size {about 9 feet long and 6 feet high) this was2 and still is,
considered highly unlikely. Indeed enquiries made both at the time
and Subsequently failed to reveal any radar trace of anything unusual

in the area at the time.

Col Halt also reports-on hi3 own investigations at the site of
the incident the following day. Once aga£n he draws no conclusions
from his findings and, significantly, does not recemmend further
investigatian. Gur awn viaw also was that ma aédiﬁional acticn was
required. Later on the night 0? 29 Dec 86 Cal Halt and a number of

others saw more unusual lights, but agaim we have no record of

anything untawaéd being gicked u? on radar,

I think ymu will agree that it,is highly unlikely that any
vialatiam 3f 3K airagace Hamid ﬁe hﬁraided by such a display af
lights. I thiﬁk 1% $qually uniikely that any weecnmaissance or

a iﬁﬁ aetivit; waulé ha aﬁﬁéuaaeé 1a thiﬁ wayk
