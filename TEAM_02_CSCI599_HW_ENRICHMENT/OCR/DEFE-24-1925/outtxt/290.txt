Thank you for your letter of 5 April 1985, addressed to the
Secretary of State for Defence. You may find it useful if I explain
that the sole interest of the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence in
reported sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects (8503) is to
establish whether they have any bearing on the defence of the
country.

There is no organisation in the Ministry of Defence appointed
solely for the purpose of studying reports of such objects, and no
staff are employed on the subject full time. The reports we receive
are referred te the staff in the Department who are responsible for
the air defence of the United Kingdom, and they examine the reports
as part of their normal duties.

We have to recognise that there are many strange things to be
seen in the sky, but we believe there are adequate explanations for
them. They may be satellite debris re~entering the earth atmOSphere,
ball lightning, unusual cloud formations, meteorological balloons,
aircraft lights, aircraft at unusual angles or many other things.
There is certainly no evidence that "alien spacecraft“ have landed on
the planet. Although we have not carried out our own studies, we are
aware of independent studies into the UFOs, notably by the University
of Colorado published in 1969. This concluded that 90% of all UFOs
reported could be plausibly related to ordinary phenomena.

Turning specifically to the incident at RAF Weodbridge, the
incident was reported to the MOD on 13 January 1981 in the report
from Lt Col Halt which you mention in your letter. A copy of this
report is attached for your interest. At that time we satisfied
ourselves that the incident was of no defence significance and no
further inVestigations were undertaken. There is no question of a
cover up ever this incident.

Yours sincerely
