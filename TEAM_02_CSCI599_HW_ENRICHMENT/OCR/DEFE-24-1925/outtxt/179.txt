Lley‘s comet is on its way back. It should become vis—

Le to the naked eye in December. It will be a chance for

nbers to hbserve the comet, if they have not already

1e so. Uhfortuneately observers in the Northern Hemis—

are (like us) won‘t be ble to get a brilliant view of

a comet due to unfavourable approach, which places the

1 between us and the comet at Perihelion.

:owever it will be visible to the naked eye low down in
eSouth by early 1986, .

According to our expert behind our telescopes, Trevor ‘

3d, we should _be able to see down to magnitude_ +13,

15 or minus magnitude depending on sky conditions,

erefore it will be around mid August that we may get ourii

rst glance at the comet through one of our main teles—
pes. Then over the next few months its positiOn_can be
otted among the stars and notes made of its gradual
