Thank you for your etter of 6 January 3985, I am sorry that I
have been unable to reply before now.

With regard to the concern you express ?beut the book "SKy
Crasn”, the only infermatien we have on the alleged ”UFO v1"nflwv“ at
Rendlesham Forest in December 1980 is the report b1 Celenel Charles
Halt, of the United States Air Farce; We are setisfied that the
events described ar e of no defence signifiea n ea 1 can eesure yea
that there is no question of attempting to QO€€T up any incident 3?
mishap, nor are we attempting in any way to ObSGLife the truth.

Under the rules laid down by the Public Records ﬁets,1les
must remain closed until 30 years have elapsed since the 183b£ ecti on
taken on them. .The earliest UFO files of Khich we have reeerds a“e
dated 1962 However, any files which do remain from 1953, 0?
earlier, may be obta ined direct from the Public Reeerds Office at

Ruskin Avenue‘r‘Kewa Richmond, Surrey TW9 ADU.
