Thank you for your letter of 20 epril 3985 concerning UFO'S, I
am sorry that l have been unable to reply before now. You may find
it useful if I explain that the sole interest of the United Kingdom
Ministry of Defence in reported sightings of Unidentified Flying
Objects (UFOs) is to establish whether they have any bearing on the
defence of the country“

There is no organisation in the Ministry of Defence appointed
solely for the purpose 0f studying reports of such objects, and no
staff are employed on the subject full time. The reports we receive
are referred to the staff in the Department who are responsible for
the air defence of the United Kingdom, and they examine the reports
as part of their normal duties.

Since our interest in UFOs is limited to possible defence
implications we have met carried out a study inte the scientific
significance of these phenomena. Unless there are defence
implications we do not attempt to identify sightinge and we cannot
inform observers of the probable identity of the object seehg The
Department could not justify the expenditure of public funds on
investigations which go beyond the pure defence intehests.

1 am afraid we do not keep the statistical information which
you ask for. However, I attach copies of two recent Parliamentary
Questions on the Ministry of Defenee's interest in UFO reports, which
you may be interested in. I also enclose a copy of the UFO article
which appeared in the July 1957 issue of the RAF Flying Review which

you asked for in your letter.
