Unexp1ained Lights

RAF/CC

l. Ear}y in the morning of 27 Dec 80 (approxinmte7y 03ODL), two USAF
security police patreTmen saw unu5ua1 lights outside the back gate at
RAF Hoodhridge. Thinking an aircraft might have crashed or been farced
down, they calied for permission to go outside the gate to investigate.
The on-duty f¥ight chief reeponded and a}10wed three patrolman is pre—
ceed on foot. The individuals reported seeing a strange glowing object
in the forest. The object was described as being metaiic in appearance

'and triangular in shape, approximateEy two to three meters across the

base and approximate}y two meters high. It 111uminated the entire forest
with a white 1ight. The object itse}f had a pulsing red 1ight on top and
a bank(s) of blue lights underneath. The object was hovering or on legs.
As the patrolmen approached the object, it maneuvered through the trees
and disappeared. At this time the anima}s on a nearby‘farm went into a
frenzy. The object was brieny sighted approximately an hour 1ater near
thé back gate. ,

2. The next day, three depressions 1 1/2" deep and 7” in diameter were
found where the object had been sighted on the ground. The foIiowing
night (29 Dec 80) the area was checked for radiation. Beta/gamma readings
of 8.} miliiroentgens were recorded with peak readings in the three de~
presséons and near the center of the triang1e formed by the depressions.

A nearby tree had moderate (.OS~ 07) readings on the side of the tree
toward the depressions. '

3. Later in the night a red Sun—like light was seen through the trees.

It moved about and puised. At one point it appeared to throw off glowing
particles and then broke into five separate white Objects and then dis—
appeared. Immediately thereafter, three sterilike objects were noticed

in the sky, two objects to the nerth and One to the south, all of which _
were about 10° off the horizon. The objects moved rapid}y in sharp angu1ar
movements and disp]ayed red, green and b1ue lights. The objects to the
north appeared to be e11iptica1 through an 8~}2 power lens. They then
turned to ful1 circles. The objects to the north remained in the sky for
an hour or nmre. The object to the south was visib]e for two or three
heurs and beamed down a stream of 1ight from time to time. Numerous indivi—
dua}s, including the undersigned, witnessed the activities in paragraphs

2 and 3.
