"Perhaps the UFO question

a PART~TW02 WHAT WE KANE DISCOVERED ABOUT UFOS. Unmasking
;the fakes, In the next pages are Some recent UFO pictures
,and some older ones. we would like to paes comments on
them, and hopefully the reader may agree with us. If not,
let us_heargfrem you as to why? '

IN $978; tWo‘New_Zealand cameramen, obviously using a video
oerimilaf camera, took what they thought WaS'a UFO. well
mayhethereteebneo But the shot they also toek'with their
camera might‘have been a bright planet; I have had the SAME
effects on epeh equipmenta Some video Cameras tend-to make
“streaks out of Sharp bright lights. we do not think that
-the reproduqed‘phote of the New Zealand sighting, Which
was annduneed on TV at the time, Was_a'UFO flight path.

We believe it Was a television camera STREAK image. There—
fore in~our Opinion this iS'a féheguﬁintentionally.

I believe’thaﬁ;_99.9% of all UFO sightings are seen at NIGHT. The

:very rare appearances these objects make in the daylight make up

the reét. How can therefore, the media who print photos like the

Vones-abeve;dec1are”for a FACT that the squiggle on the left is a
;”flight path of a UFO”? ware they THERE!

It was ASSUMED too,the
photo on the right, was nothing more that an out of focus shot

As I remember it, the path of
the aireraft was followed the next day, and several normal every~
day items ceuld account for these two photos above. Until further
eveidence come out of hiding, we will assume these are camera
blurbs, Unless of course, you know better?
