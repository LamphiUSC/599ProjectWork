It grieves me to add that I think we have some evidence of direct and delib—
erate mis-statement on the part of the Ministry of Defence in at least one important
case, the occurrence of strange events on two nights in late December 1980 in a part
of Rendlesham Forest adjoining the USAF Base at RAF Woodbridge. We have the evidence
for these events in a statement si ned on 13th January 1981 by the then Deputy Base
Commander, Lt.Col. (now Bnigezié3ﬂgﬁnesaé) Charles Halt of the United States Air
Farce. This statement was not made public until 14th June 1983 when ~ following
persistent pressure by the authors of CLEAR INTENT (see above) — its release was
authorised by the USAF in America under the Freedom of Information Act. Whether this
release was an inadvertency at rather low level in the USAF we may never know: despi1
the Freedom of Information Act, American agencies have proved perfectly capable (and
often no doubt with good reason) of sustaining objections in the courts to the re1~
~weesewofwdecumentswwTherewisweerteinlywseme~evidencemthatwﬂaltmwaswnotwconsultedmebou1
the release and that it somewhat dismayed him. Be that as it may, however, the lettea
of release included the extraordinary statement that the USAF had disposed of its¢mn
copy of Halt's report but that: “... through diligent inquiry and the gracious CURSE!
of Her Majesty's government, the British Ministry of Defence and the Royal Air Force‘
the US Air Force was provided a copy for yen." The Ministry of Defence have confine
in reply to a Parliamentary Question tabled by Major Sir Patrick Wall, MP, that a
copy of Halt's report was indeed received by them. Yet we are told in a recent book ‘
SKYCRASH by Brenda Butler, Dot Street and Jenny Randles (Neville Spearman ﬁgd., 1984
that the Ministry of Defence had flatly denieé any knowledge of supposeﬁi Rendiesh:
Forest when enquiries were made to them in 1981, following strong local rumours of a
extraordinary occurrence.

The Ministry of Defence may well have good reasons for witholding information
about the Rendieshem incidents. As a former Defence_pfficia1,1 Would not wish to
press questions on any matter touching national security; and in those circumstances
I would not be surprised if questions pressed by others were met by a refusal to
reply. But I cannot help feeling that it is something of a lapse from the usual
standarﬁs of a government department to issue a direct mie-etatement. Concealment is
one thing (and is often justified), false denial is quite anather.

The RAF Woodbridge case of December 1980 strikes me as one of the most interes
ing and important of recent years, anyway in this country - perhaps the most signifi
cant militarz sighting (or supposed sighting) since the celebrated events of 13th/14
August 1956 near RAF Bentwaters and RAF Lakenheath (both of which are, by an enter~
taining coincidence, quite close to Woodbridge in that much«haunted county of Suffol
Those who wish to study the Bentwaters/Lakenheath incidents will find descriptions
of them in the books mentioned belowg The RAF Woodbridge case is described at length
in SKYCRASH (see above). It is also to be the subject of several radio and televisio
pregremmes. Much was said ebeut it in THE REVS OF THE NORLD in 19833 mainly in its
issues of 2nd and 9th October. Alone in Fleet Street, the then editor, Derek Jameson
decided to give space to Halt's report; and Keith Beebey of THE NEWS OF THE WORLD
pursued it vigorously in the face of the kind of ridicule which the “quality" news—
papers seem.to find it expedient to attach to this mysterious and persistent phenom—
enon. '

It was the Woodbridge case which prompted me ta take up a long—shelved intenti
to write a "UFO book". I have chosen, quite deliberately, to cast it as a piece of
fiction. Fiction allows the imagination to range widely, and it seems to me that thi
can sometimes be productive in turning better—qualified minds to new aspects of a
groblem. A false hypothesis can often have as much heuristic value as a good one 2
It does, at the least, enable serious researchers to consider — and properly test -
a new idea, even if only to throw it away when it fails to stand up to scrutiny. I a
far from being wedded to the hypothesis.on which A SECRET PROPERTY is based. The
main object of the book is to entertain, and to do so in the form of a thriller. It
most certainly does not reflect any inside knowledge or startling revelation on the‘
part of a former Defence official. (If I had such knowledge, the Official Secrets Ac
would forbid me to reveal it !). '
