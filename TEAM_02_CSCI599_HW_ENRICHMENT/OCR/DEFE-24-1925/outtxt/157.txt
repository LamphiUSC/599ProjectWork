cummon type of start“ he explains, " and there an: many others
lIke it in thc Universct 1t scams most likely that these stars will
also have planets, UFOs could came from these planets."

Gravity still remains Dr. Thornton's main interest and ht:
continues his researches HI: has told me that ix should soon
be possible to build a device which would cnablc man to oven
come gravity without recourse to wings 0r jet lift If he has
:my success with this, then Dr Tharnton may be well On the
way to buil ding a Fl3ing Saucer of his own‘

In t t

ES then: no ofﬁcial inquiry Into the Flying Saucer mystery?
TWO years a 10 the AI: Ministry pronounced:

‘ About ninety per cent of the reports (of Fi3ing Saucers}
have been found to relate to mctcors, balloans. Ham; and many
other objects. The fact that the other ten per cent remain
unexplained may be attributed to nothing more sinister than
lack of data.” And it has said vcr' little else until May 05
this year. Then. Mr. Gdorgc Ward, wretary of State for Mt
said. In answer to a questmn In Ihe House. that there had been
so far this year live objccts sighted which cauld not br:
cxplmncd. This compared: hc went on. with sit; In Nib, mm
:1"! 1955 and six in 3‘954.

The Air Mmtstry m" It not elaborate en this statement WI.-
arc luft to presume that the IInidcnuﬁcds this 3cm Include thc
Wardle m35tcn and (2%: radar slghtmg from West Frcugh.

But there are many people. mhcr than the ardent saucer
fans, who would llke to know the answer. People like ex
Squadron Leadar Ernest Booker of Lcwcr Héllnormn Road.
Rugb) Just after 9:1 .171 (III Tuesday ctobcr 23, last 39.5“: Mr.
Banker nov. a schuolmaster sax» a strange sight in the night 3123:

“ There were two ﬂights m: said‘ about twice the sﬁzc of ant
craft nangatian lights scan {mm l 500 feet am! a light amber in
colour They awe different from anything else I haw cxcr
sue: During the war Mr. Booker was a pilotwan instructor
at the Cantu} Fl3iIIg School.

“The most mysterious thing about these lights v.35 that they
made no noise u. hatsocxer.‘ he continued. they acre: mo‘ mg
.airl3 slowty against a tight breeze from east to must. quite lmv,
about ISOO feet ug. As they maxed tin. tights sccmcd t0

Many other peop‘m in the Rugby district 33,» Itxum. The
ex Squadron Leader was quite sure that thc3 wcru neither
balloons nor glxders; neither an aircraft nor a scarchlight
reﬂecting on a mom} What they were he docs not know, but
he would very much like to known, _

And so the saucer mysicry mm'cs on ?crhaps by August.
