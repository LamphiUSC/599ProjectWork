of the mysterious circies. Once again the

out a UFO report. ’ .

A brillianﬂy ht circuiar object was seen
hovering ' over Stockbridge . Down,
Hampshire by Jack and Pat Cofﬁns whitst
driving home one night. Mrs Collins said
‘It, looked like a big fum‘air' wheel
hovering in the sky’. The object was not
visibte for very tong as the road along
which the couple were travemng was tree
lined and the object was therefore
biotted out by the trees. They made no
attempt to stop for a better Iook but on
reaching home telephoned the potice,
who searched the area but found nothing.

Atthough the object was not visihte for
very tong, perhaps five minutes at the

*most, Mr Cohins was able to} make a

sketch, which perhaps proVides the first '

clue as to what might be responsibte for

If an object such as that described
above were to land and the underside of
the craft. with it’s spoke tike- eenstruction,
were to rotate as it did 39 or once it had
:anded, then it would atmost certainty
produce the neat pattern of flattened
crop which is afeature of these circtes. Of
course attached to this large circuiar
object there woutd have to be four
smallerones which must aiso rotate in the
same way. Again from the neat way in
which the crop is flattened within the
smelter circles they would have to have
the same constructien.

Mr and Mrs Coltins did not see anything
attached to the large circuiar object they
observed hovering over the countryside.
However, if we accept the fact that a UFO
was responsible for the‘circles —- and by
