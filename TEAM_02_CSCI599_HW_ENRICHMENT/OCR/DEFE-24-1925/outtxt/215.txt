Dear—

Thank you very much for your helpful letter of 10 July 1985 in reply to mine
of 18 May 1985.

E

I am grateful to you for having gone to the trouble of providing me with a

list of sightings reported from all sources for the period 1978—1984, but note
that my question remains unanswered. While I realise that my request for the
number of military sightings from 1959—1984 was a tall order, I still need to
have some idea of the number of these ~ particularly concerning the RAF ~ in

a given period. May I therefore re—phrase my question as follows: How many
reports of UFOs have been made by RAF personnel from 1965—1975? If that‘s too
time—consuming, may I ask: How many reports of UFOs were made by RAF pilots in
1967?

 

 

 

As you point out, there has been no evidence to date to indicate a defence threat
or significance, so would your department have any objection to releasing details
in order to assist me in my researches? As already mentioned, I have Obtained a
few reports from the early Fifties which have obviously been declassified under
the 30—year rule, but it is well known that pilots in the RAF have been seeing,
these things since then: certainly the Bentwaters case (I956)is a good example.

I am glad to note that AS—Z is now the point to which all reports of UFOs are
sent. But what about AS-8, which was mentioned to me by a reliable source? What
are its functions, please? '

Finally, I was inteteSted to hate that your department recognizes that there are
”phenomena“, even if you think there is no defenCe significance to them, and that
no scientific study has been carried out.

If possible, I would appreciate a reply within four weeks. Thank you.

With best wishes

Yours sincerely
