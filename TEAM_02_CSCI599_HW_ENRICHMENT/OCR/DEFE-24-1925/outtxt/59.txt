1. In January of 1978, I was station at HcGuire AFB, N.J.. One evening , during the

timn frame or 0300hrs. and 0500hr3., there were a number of UFO sightins in the iraa aver
the £1: field and Ft. DIX Army sang. I am a sacurity policeman and was 6n routinm patrol
at the time. N.J. State Police, and Ft. Dix EP's ware runnig coda in the direction of
8rownsvilla,N.J.. A state trocper then entered Cat» #5 at- the ruar or the base requaating
assistance and permission to entur. I was dispatched and the trooper Wanted acceaw to tha
runway area which led to the very back of the air field and connected with a hiavily wauﬁm '
ed area which is part of the Dix training area. -He informed me that 8 Ft. Dix E? was
pursuaing a low flying object which‘then hcvared over his car. 3: describad it an awn
shaped, with no details, and glowing with a bluoish green galor. His radio transmisgicm
was cut off. At that time in front of his police: car, appeared a thing, abcut kit. tam?
grayish, brown, fat head, long armsu and slender body. The H? panicked and firaé fiva
round: from his .hS Cal into tbs thing, and can rousﬁ into the object abava. Tia object
then {lad straight up and joined with eleven other: high in the sky. This at all sgu

but didn't kncv the details at the time. Anyway, The ting ran into the woods towarda our
fencolina and they wanted to look for it. By this time several patrols were involved.

2. Vb fbund the body of the thing near the runway. It had apparently climbad thm fanca
and died while runningg It was all or a sudden hush-hush and an on: was allowed near

thc area. Rh roped off the area and AF OSI cama out and task over. That was tha lazt K
savior it. There was a bad stench coming from it too. Like ammonia gmtlling but it
wasn't cnnstent in the air. That day, a team from wright-Patterson AFB came in a 0131

and went to the area. They crated it in a wooden box, sprayed something over it; and then
put it into a bigger metal container. They loaded it in the plane and took off. Thﬁt

was it, nothing more said, no report made and we were all tcld not to have aaything to
say about it or us would be court martialed.

3. I will be getting out of tha air force in about two months. Do Not diaclosa my nant
as I could.get into trcuble. I am interested in :ursuing this and other matterﬁ if you '
need help. Forgive me for not signing this.but I can‘t take any chancas. Pleasa raply
to the above address and my parents will forward it to ma 6? I will be name xlreaéya
Don't send it here because they menitor all mail closely and I again don't want ta
