 

THE HISTORY OF THIS MAGAZINE CONTINUED.

GNK GAINED IN popularity from 1972 to July I979, when it ﬁ§9
finalIy closed 'NEVER TO APPEAR AGAIN‘. This was due to two
reasons. ﬂTﬁZTiret one was FINANCE. Neceuse the magazine
was and still is INTERNATIONAL, the postage ooste made ’ J
the price of CNK slightly inhibitive for those readers who
obviously couldn't or finally'wouldn‘t pay for them. Despite
sad letters received from regular readers, the costs and ‘
the fact that the second reason was, we wanted to start up "
ANOTHER magazine, we decided the best thing to do wee to"
fold up CNK for good. ,~ .
WHY IS IT STILL. HERE1? WeIl, only just! CNK still con—
tinued to receive exchange magazines from alI over theinrld,
and encouraging letters too. I aid not want to stop reoe—
iving these, so I put ouE GNK for EURQEE instead. It was '
the cheper way. By not being involved with English copies

the ooets went down, and CNK continued Naturally people

in Europe do not all epsék Englishl Therefore it was also

a good excuse for me to learn severaI European Languages.
I was now committed. I had to proiuoe CNK in German, '
Swedish, Italian, Danish, a tiny bit of Frenoh, and thenr‘
nearly too- Russian This took up many many. man hours

with various foriegn dictionaries in my hand, tranélating
both ways. Sometimes hilarious, sometime fine, But CNK
continued.
There always now has to be an ' exouse' for me to 'bring

out another issue‘. So because the climete was right...

out came two more issues. TEE STANSTEAD SPACE SHUTTER 3
ISSUE 28 and the SUFFOLK UFO LANDING CASE issue 2T.

The excuse for THIS issue is that I have a backlog

of UFO and other data to get out, and ultimately dispose '
of, being within these pages now. —BUT I MUST AEMIT

that is closing down CNK I have lost all my circulation.

Those who I sent copies to last time in good faith,

still have not sent in their payment. Thatwas 1984!

Come now Lads and Lassies, if this magazine is to
m1ke anything of a comebadk its up to you to support

it. I don‘t MIND giving GNK away in an exchange or

as a first SANELE cepy, but we can't do it for all

THIS ISSUE OF CNK IS “REALLY ISSUE 30.3 WTO OUR

BHt¥ ﬁe ATE BEEN ISSUE 28, not 27. This was an oversight 0
part. 7 suue 28 THE SPACE SHUTLLE ISSUE was supossed to be
29 . THERJFENE THIS ISSUE WILL HEYE T0 EEENEiA IUINT NEETT
29/30 to try to sort out the puzzle and bring the whole nu

 

2 back again in the right order. Obviously these issues new

 

“ noboEy seems to want it.

 

out cannot be recalled and altered, therefore I have taken

'action for thqeeﬂgf‘gou who are collecting CNK for librari

M O V I N G

“COSMOLOGY-NEWSLINK”has moved address three times since 197

because of this also, some of your letters, some containin
scriptions;~or~sihgle payments have only just been disoove
in the last few weeks. We are terribly sorry about this. A
they are about three years old, hopefully ihe reader will
be at his address when he or she receives this iesue...out
the blue, now!

T H E F U T U RIE

WHO KNOWS what the future may bring. It is very nice to vi
what could happen to CNK in the next 5 years. Maybe we wi
another method of production which will make it QUIGKER ax
to produce, as well as cheaper. Maybe we will get back ou1
GIRCGLATION of 1975-80, and that will get us back agamn or
manent heels. IT IS ENTIRELY UP TO THE SUBSCRIBER. If you
send us your payments, and YOU know who you are, then unle
can get advartising cover ONK will only appear eporodioal]
BUT, GNK GOULD WELstanish for good, along with all the c
The reasons are numerous. Family oommittments. CNK only he
producer, myself I -get no help in the production side frc
body. I DO ggt help article wise, but that is all. What be
me effects the magazine. It would be nice if when I get t<
of 1V 0 pass it On to someone else...but there lies the 1
TELEVISION and TELEPHONES are p:
to blame. I must admit, I too am addictedto the small sore
times. J Mayhe one day magazines will cease to look like i
and will be contained On video tape, or similar storage. I
the main it is far easmer to flick through a book than h:
find whaE you are looking for on a TV screen.

Well, there you have it. GNK could well vanish. It is he
mainly because of MY enthusiasm. CNK I‘S YOUR VOICE. YOU‘
US TO SAX WHAT YOU WANT in cosmological circles. It is t]

  

board'for you to write on.Lets hear from you. For now its
WELCOME BACK to the 1930‘s.
