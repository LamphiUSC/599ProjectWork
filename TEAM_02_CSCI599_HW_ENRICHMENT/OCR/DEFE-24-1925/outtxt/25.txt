THE UFO PHENOMENON

The two beings returned to their machine; the door
closed, the legs whirled and retracted, and the machine
left the ground silently. When it was between fifteen and
twenty metres away, it suddenly vanished. About ﬁfteen
minutes later feeling returned to Masse and he was able to
move again: he WOI‘kECl until between 7.30 or 8 am, then
went back to the Village, where he told his adventure at a
cafe. Being known and respected in the neighbourhood!
his Story was taken seriously and thoroughly investigated
both by the police and by private UFO investigative
groups: though some contradictions were noted, no

In selecting these examples, I have deliberately chosen
relatively simple and unsensational cases, occurring to

None of these people was particularly interested in

tlelusion or preconception. In all six cases, the sighting
came as a total surprise, to which the Witness had to adjust

going to bed, returning home, doing the daily work. In
each case the witness responded with emotions ranging
from mild puzzlement to complete bafﬂement; in each
case subsequent investigation, while it has failed to
discover the true explanation, has also failed to show that
the witness in any way misreported the incident. In short,
these things seem to have taken place as described, for all
myone can show to the contrary.

Of course, some of them are capable ofsome kind of
explanation. For several of them, a helicopter might
