1:“;Q BRITISH. UFO watchers believe our defence chiefs have hel

an Americaﬁ oover—up aBOut EFGS.

So far, they say, the Defence Ministry have failed to e
an amazing sequence of sightihgs, some by RAF officers.

Mrs Pauline Coombs claims she was chased by a UFO as sh
her children home to Ripplestone Farm.- As she reached it
wiring burnt out. That was in January 1977. Before the ye
out she and her husband Billy reported seeing. UFO's at 0
quarters many times.

CNK COMMENT: I think it is dda that after UIO's have be
and reported in a certain area, they then are never seen
in that area for a long time° Isn't that strange! It sma
a secret government invention being tested-out, which wb
DISCOVERED is quiCKly withdrawn when it is reported from
'secret' testing area, or in the night; or a a time when
us should he in bed. In other words, a man made machine
haé not q- te ready for use, or will NEVER be revealed 6
THINK ABOUT IT! Radar was secret at or
SUE: They also say they saw 7ft tall ( approx 2—m)figure
glowing silter clothes and helmets.

Across St. Bride s Bay, Mrs Rosa Grenville, an honours g
who runs the Haver Fort Hotel with her husband, Eddieg
she saw UFO's land twice. weird figures got out and prov
around. _

At Broadhaven school, 14 children aged between 1C and .
their headmaster they had seen a UFO land 200 yards fro:
they were playing. He separated them and told them to d:
they saw. Their drawings matched. So did their reports.
headmaster Richard Llwhelin said: ”Children of that age
capable of maintaining such an elaborate hOaX.”

GTJ: As if in answee to my above comments we seea~

SEE continued: It is an area bristling with defence est
ments, SOME HIGHLY SECRET. (capitals ours) The RAF con
a flood of reports and said the sightings did not match
operations. (well it wouldn‘t if it mas—seeret~would it

But on June 15, 1977, the then Ialiametary Uhder—secre
for Defence, Mr. James EelIbeIOVed told loaal Tory M. P.
