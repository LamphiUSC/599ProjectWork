Sunday 15th” July '84.

‘Dear Sirs,
_ On the evening of Wednesday the 11th. inst., I, together
with my two neighbours observed an object at a.very great height.
I 2 It shone with the magnitude of Venus at it's brightest.
We observed it through binoculars. -
.ﬂIt did not move for a period of about half an hour.
{From our viewpoint it was at approximately 600 and in an estimated
N.w. direction.
It appeared to have circular form. ‘
I first noticed it at about 9.t5 (21.i5) and observed it until
'about 21.45 at which time I went indoors to fetch my x25 telescope.
‘ However, upon finding the 'scope I was disappointed to find that
' the object had disappeared.
I had however fixed it's position by alighing it with the corner
of the roof. 7
The time was then almost 22.00. .
.Upon making a further aligned viewing I found I.was looking at
a.point approximately in the centre-of the "Plough" which was by
then faintly visiblex ‘

My neighbeurs would corroborate.
Your‘s Faithfully,
Secﬂon40 -'
