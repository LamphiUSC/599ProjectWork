MKNAGEMENT IN CONFIDENCE

UNCLASSHHED

. . UFOs 4 DRAFT CLOSING ADDRESS

There ere three grains of truth upon which the great

myth of ufology is built.

FIRST: intelligent life could exist elsewhere in the
universe. With 100,000 million stars in our own
galaxy alone, it is probable that there are many

' planete capable 9f supporting life.

SECOND: the technical difficulties of inter—stellar

travel are stunning.E#en at the speed of light

1 it would take 4 years to reach the nearest star,
and 100,000 years to cross bur galaxy. But it
would be a brave man who said there could never,
ever,be manned inter—stellar travel. A

THIRh: there really are strange phenomena in the skies,
and mahy are reported by cool and intelligent

_ peoPle.

2. But it is a far cry from this to the proposition that there
have beeh great numbers of sightings of UFO: 9 implying alien space
craft — sometimes claimed as running into hundreds of thousands.
Ber majesty's Government is not in the least imgressed with the
idea that there is anything worth investigating 1n the information
offered by ufologiets.
3.‘ 0n the one bend, there are perfectly eimple explanations
for the phenomena; on the other, the explanations offered by
ufologists are most unconvincing. These explanations are unm
convincing when they relate to epace craft from other stars: they
I are even more unconvincing when they claim that UFOs come from
another Spaceatimediwwnshv») from a hole in the earth, or the

_depths of the sea, as Lord Clancarty has suggested.
