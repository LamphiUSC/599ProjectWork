.r‘l' ¢£.~ There has been no epproach to Governments, and no direct

knowledge of UFOs by Governments. Lord Clancarty has an
answer: there is a great inter-Governmental conspiracy of

silence, initiéted by the CIA.

15. The idea of the inter-Governmental conspiracy of Silence
is at once the moet astonishing and the most flattering claim
of all. Oh so few things can the Governmentsof the world agree
unaminouely, bht they have all supposedly agreed to conceal the
evidence of UFOs from their peoples. Let me assure this House
that Her Majesty's Government hae never been approached by
people from outer space.
16. There'ie no internal consistency about the idea of this huge
number of sightings. If they have come from another solar system,
what is the point of this huge number of visits to our planet,
to no aptarent purpose? At best it seems wasteful. This was
once explained by the claim that aliens had advance bases the
other side of the moon. When that became untenable the baees
'were assumed to be on another planet.in our solar system. he
that has become untenable ever more fantastic explanations are
advanced. in a°recent TV broadcast Lord Clancarty claimed that
the UFOs are based th a great hole in the earth.- Elsewhere he
has claimed that they have bases in remote parts of South America,
or in the depths of the oceans. Because1hese physical place:
have become untenable he has claimed that (I quote): 'UFOs are
- paranormal, that is from invisible universee'. They come from
'other space-time continua'. Another urologist talks of 'space
mind/full mind/Mana'. Indeed the explanations get more and more
ifantaetic, and more and more incapable of either proof or dis-

proof.
