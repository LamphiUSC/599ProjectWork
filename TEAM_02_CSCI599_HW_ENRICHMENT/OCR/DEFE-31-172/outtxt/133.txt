Meteorological eearchlighte shine on clouds: you cannot

see the beam, only a light apparently dancing in the
sky.

A surprieing number of reports relate to aircraft seen in

'unnsual cenditions at unusual angles, some very high, some

at low level. One recent 'UFO' was confidently reported
on local radio: we cannot prove that it was not a 'UFO', but

we do know that an RAF Vulcan bomber on a low flying mission

‘baeeed the same sppt at the same time and on the same course

as the reported UFO.

And satellites: there are some 5000 1isted.objects in orbit,
satellites and space debris.' More are added each year, and
abdut 600 re—enter the atmosphere every year. Early this
year_MOD received many reports of a large péice of debris
qefenfhﬂéxg acrose the South of England: most reports
were factual, but one spoke of an 'ovel shaped thing with a

white cockpit which hoverecl for a while than shot off at

- great speed'. We cannot prove it wasn't a UFO, but it

occurred at the‘eame time and place as some known re-entry
of space debris.

And of course there are optical illusions. Any phenomena
thrdugh glaes_are particularly suspect.

There are alao genuine hallucinations, sometimes en people

under stress; the excited tales of the gullible; the embellishments

of the horn story teller. Also, I fear, downright lies. There

.are also hoaxes: there are some very effective aerial hoaxes which

have been perpetrated by children a which I will not describe for

fear of preciﬁitating a new rash of UFO reports.
