British Citizens: Overseas Supplements

Lord Hatch of Lusliy: My Lords, I beg leave to ask
the ﬁrst Question which stands in my name on the
Order Paper.

The Question was as follows:

To ask Her Majesty‘s Government howr many
British citizens received British Expatriates Supple-
mentation Schcmc or Overseas Service Aid Scheme
supplements in 1979 and in l931 and what further
changes are planned.

The Parlizmtcntary Untlor-Sccretary of State, Foreign
and Comnmmt'cnlth Oﬁicc (Lord Trofgarnc): My
Lords, the aycragu number of British Citizens receiving
British Expatriates Supplcmcntation Scheme or Ovcr-
seas Service Aid Schcmc supplements in 1979 was
4,083. "in 1981, the comparable ﬁgure was 2,975.
The numbers have fallen steadiiy since 1970 anti
reductions are expected to continue'at about 10 per
cent. itcr annum over the next few years.
in terms of service are plan Kid at the moment.

Lord I-Intch 0f Lushy: My Lords, may I ask the. noble
Lord thc_ Minister whether he has read the Answer
given by his colleague to_:t similar- Question which 1
put in Dcccmhcr‘? 'l‘hc Answer, which I paraphrase,
was that thc numbers had fallen bcczlusc local indi-
genous pauplc haul now become sufﬁciently trained to
take them: positions. if the noble Lord has looked
since. at these ﬁgures, would he agree that this is not
an adequate answer and that this is a deliberate policy
by the Goycrnmcnt to reduce the. number of British
'citizcns who are given supplcmcnts to work overseas?
Would the noble Lord further agree that this is causing.
very great (lilliculty to universities, to technical colleges
and to a whole range til tmtional activities in thc
Cohtmom't’calth ‘? -

‘ Lord Trcl'gn :10: No, I do not agree with that, my
Lords. I have indeed studied the. Answer which my
noble friend Lord Slzcln‘crsdalc gave to the noble
Lord, Lord Hatch ol” Lusby, at the cm! of last year.
The reasons which my noble friend then gave rcnmin
correct.

Lorri Hutch (if Ltzsliy: But surely the ﬁgures “hich
have hccn given this afternoon, it'l heard correctly.
have reduced thc number by about 25 per cén’ in two
years. Dam this not entail a grant reduction in
h'itish inlltisncc all m'cr thc C0l11:n(m‘.‘.‘Citilit? And
is the. nohlc Lo't'cl aware. that pm‘tiwlurly in univcr'sitics
it is causing; wow great :mxicty and difﬁculty over tht-
t'ccruitn‘tcnt of thc rcquisitt: trained stun"?

Lord 'I'rcfgnrnc: ‘vly Lords, thc numbcrs have indccd
(lcclincd, as l (lcsurilmd in the original Answcr and as
was referred to at the time of the earlier Question at
the 0nd of last year. But one has to rcmcmbcr that
thcsq schemes are operated in thc closest consultation
with the various Governments concerned, and they
sometimes choose to use the aid funds for .0010:-
purposes.

The I-Jnrl of Clmtcarty: My Lords, I beg leave to
asl: thc Qucstion WillCil stands in my namc on the

taken in each case.

sightings; in 1979 there were 550 sightings; in 1980,

' 350 sightings; and in 198], 600 sightings. All UFO

reports are passed to operations staff who examine
them solely for possible (tcfcncc implications.
