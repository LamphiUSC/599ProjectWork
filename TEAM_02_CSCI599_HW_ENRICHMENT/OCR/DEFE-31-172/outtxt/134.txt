9. ' In sum, we cannot prove that all or even most of these so-
called sightings were not UFOs. But we can say that there is a
great variety of phenomena in the skies for which there are .
-perfect1y ordinary explahatione. We have no heason to believe
that the so-called UFOs are attributed to anything but these same
causes. - - I I '

10. But what of these famous arrivals of UFOs, claimed to be
fully documented and authenticated by many witnesses. On
scrutiny they tend to be elusive. I will select one, which
Lord Giancarty has deacéibed in his book Mysterious Visitors
as 'one at the most_remarkab1e and unexplained mysteries of
modern times'. He claims that during the Gallipogg campaign
in 1315, an entire British regiment, the First Fourth Norfolke,
was advancing towards Hill 60: a cloud descended and picked up
the regiment and it was never heard of again ....... (checking
with Army Historical Branch)

11. As I have indicated,there is no critieiem of those who
accurately report phenomena. The criticism is of over-readinees
to call them JUFOS', and to transpose that into 'alien space
craft'. The reports aﬁam?aeaed withoht critical scrutiny to

I .
the urologists; who adgé without critical scrutiny, to their

huge files of 'reported sightings and landings'.
