Dear Sir,

Report of Unidentified Flying Object

Please find encloaed UFO report from—

This report was initially relayed to ATC Dunsfold by !
fiancée who is a % employee at Dunsfold. It Has not
passed by telephone 0 Military as I considered the time delay from
observation to receipt of the report at Dunsfold would not constitute an
'immediate' report.

The Dunsfold radar controller on duty at the time of the reported
observation does not recall seeing anything unusual on radar in the
vicinity of Horsham at the appropriate time.
