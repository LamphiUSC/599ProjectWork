with receiving and investigat1ng flying complaints.- In the zoourse'of

their duties they oecasionally receive UFQ reports (as do many other

unitS) but they have no Specific,role with regard to this shbjeot.

Secretariat (Air Staff) is the Division which provides

secretariat support to CAS and the Air Staff and in this capacity is

responsible for correspondence with members of the public and
answeriné éQs eto on man y subjects,ine1uding UFO's. Sec(AS)2 is the_
branch which amongst other thing 5 handles UFO'S, _thefe is no such
branch _as Air Staff Secretariat 8. You may be thinking of Defence
Secretariat 8 which no longer exists and from which Sec(AS)levolwed

as a result of reorganisation of MOD last January.’

e. Many of the UFO reports received in MOD come through Defence
establishments, although most of these come originally from members
of the public. Very few reports are made by military pilots; for

instance, in the last 12 months See(AS) has received only one such

report.
[GE3 to provide advice please]

e. The Department is happy to release what information we have on
'specific incidents. However we could not justify the effort involved

in searching for or collating information of a more general nature.
