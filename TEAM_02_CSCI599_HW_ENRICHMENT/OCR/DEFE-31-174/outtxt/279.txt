Lord Trefgarne has received from Admiral of the Fleet Lord Hill- -Nort0n

that Lord Hill-Norton accepts the offer of a meeting and we will

be in touch with him shortly to arrange this. I will let you know

the time and place as soon as possible, and in the meantime I

should be most grateful if you could set in hand,a’br1efing for Lord

questions a—e.
