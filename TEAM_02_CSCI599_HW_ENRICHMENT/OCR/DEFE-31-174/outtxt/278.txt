'with receiving and ihvestigating ffying complaints. .In the éouhse of
'their duties they occasionally reoeive UFQ reports (as do many other

‘units) but they have no specific role with regard to this sobject.

Secretariat (Air Staff) is the Division which provides
secretariat support to CAS and the Air Staff and in this capacity is
responsible for correspondence with members of the public and
answering PQS etc on many subjects, including UFO's. Seo(AS)2 is the
branch which amongst other things handles UFO's, there is no such
branch as Air Staff Secretariat 8. You may be thinking of Defence
Secretariat 8 which no longer exists and from which Sec(AS) evolved

as a result of reorganisation of MOD last January.‘

0. Many of the UFO reports received in MOD come through Defence
establishments, although most of these come originally from members
of the public. Very few reports are made by military pilots; for

instance, in the last 12 months Sec(AS) has received only one such

report.
[GE3 to provide advice please]
e. The_Department is happy to release what information we have on

specific incidents. However we could not justify the effort involved

in searching for or collating information of a more general nature.
