l _ I have to report that at 21.37 hours Sunday 7 July 1985 I was
' at Sowerby Bridge Police Station when I received a recort by
from aSeCtion 40_ born 22.12.15 ofm
Section 40 Rishworth. that at between 2.50 am and 3.10 am on Sunday
7 July 1985 he saw in an easterly direction from his heuse, at
an altitude of 5 above the horizon a strong white light which

he said was flickering and was travelling in a southerLy direction
towards Manchester. '

I suggested to him that this may have been a sighting of an aircraft
but he insisted that this was not the case. I therefore respectfully
suggest that this report be forwarded to the Force HQ for the
attention of Chief Superintendent, Admin and that he may feel

it worthy of being passed to the Ministry of Defence Department
