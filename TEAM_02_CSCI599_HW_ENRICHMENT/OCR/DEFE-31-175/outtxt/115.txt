Close encounters Of an alien kind

BODIES of four ‘aiiens’ from a
crashed UFO (unidentified flying
object) were recovered and exam—
ined by a special American
Government team 40 years ago,
according to a top- -secret ‘docu-
ment' obtained by a British
researcher.

A bitter debate is now likely to
develop among UFO experts over the
existence of a mysterious committee,
code-named Maiestic-IZ, which is
SUpposed to have examined the
aliens.

The highly classiﬁed brieﬁng paper
claims that the then head of the CIA,
Admiral Roscoe Hitlenkoctter, repor-
ted that ' although these creatures are
human-Iike in appearance, the biolo-
gical and evolutionary processes
respoi'tsible for their development
have apparently been quite different
[tom those observed or postulated in
homo mpuns.

The document, which has been
shown to The Observer by Timothy
Good, Britain’s leading UFO
researcher, purports to be a brieﬁng
paper for President—eiect Eisenhower
on Operation Maiestic-IZ, also
known as Ml-IZ.

In his book, ‘Above Top Secret:
The Worldwide UFO OOVer-up,’ to
be published by Sidgwick & Jackson
on 9july, Mr Good claims that MJ- [2
was a committee of senior US officials
which investigated and then covered

up news of ﬂying saucer crashes.

Other UFO experts believe the
story could he a hoax involving the
planting of a fake supporting White
House memo in the files of Air Force
Intelligence and then getting the
National Archives officially to
declassiiy I forgtttl document.

The Eisenhower brieﬁng paper,
dated 18 November. I952, claims the
Mj-lz comtitiltee had been set up by
his predecessor, President Truman,
on 24 September, 1941, as a ‘top
secret research and development]I
intelligence operation responsible
directly and Only to the President of
the United States.’

The document reports that on 24
June 1947, 'disc-shaped airmft'
were sighted in the United States.

‘ Little was learned about the
objects until a total rancher reported
that one had crashed in a remote
region of New Mexico, about 75 miles
north west of Roswell Army Air Base
(now Walkzr Field).

‘ 0n 7 July 1947, a secret operation
was begun to assure recovery of the
wreckage of this object [or scientific
study. During the course of this
operation, aerial reconnaissance dis-
covered that [our small human-like
beings had apparently eiected from
the craft at some point before it
exploded. These had [alien to earth
about two miles east of the wreckage
sue.”

Aceording to the brieﬁng paper:
‘All four were dead and badly
decomposed due to action by preda-
tors and exposure to the elements
during the approximately one week of
time which had elapsed before their
discovery.

‘ A mVert analytical effort resulted
in I preliminary consensus (19
September 1947) that the disc was
most likeiy I short-tange recon-
naissance craft . .

The Maiestic-lz Group remains of
the unanimous Opinion that imposi-
tion of the strictest security
precautions should continue without
interruption . into the new
Adminismtion.’
