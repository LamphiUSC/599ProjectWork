SUBJECT: MAJESTIC TWELVE (MJ12)
7th June 1987
SOURCE: THE OBSERVER — Sunday 31st May 1987

 

Dear Sir/Madam,

We have been informed that this department (DI—SS) deals with UFO reports and similar type

of phenomena.

we viewed the enclosed article with great interest and perhaps feel you may have some
knowledge of MJ12. If this is the case, then perhaps you could supply information on this
very unusual matter. We feel it is in the publics interest that all UFO related material
should be released, thus PROJECT ORION considers the Observer report unique in respect of

what MAJESTIC TWELVE represents.

If the Observer report is to be believed, then the worlds most powerful government, has

indeed recovered an alien craft containing ultra advanced technology.

We are currently running checks with various military departments regarding the existence
of British interest in respect of MAJESTIC TWELVE.

I look forward to receiving your reply in the near future.
