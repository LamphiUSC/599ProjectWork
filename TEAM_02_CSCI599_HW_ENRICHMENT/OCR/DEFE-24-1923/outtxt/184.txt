Dear Sir,

I enclose a statement from gof Pencader,
Dyfed regarding a U.F.O. sighting which She made on 16th February 1985
and also on the following night.

 

However I am not asking for any classified information to be
divulged to me, but I would just like to reassure
that they did in fact see something that was not a natura p enomenon
(aurora, heavenly body etc.) but that whatever it was, it did not originate
from a foreign country or indeed from outer spacel

I would only add that the_ are old friends of many
years standing, and are most reliable and levelâ€”headed witnesses.

I would be most grateful for any reassurances along the above
lines that can be given to me.

Yours faithfully,
