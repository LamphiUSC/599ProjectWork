1. Thank you f.r the refertnce and the enclosed photographs which are returned.

2. We have looked with interest at the photographs and the AAC report. Certainly
something unusual has happened but just what remains a mysteny. From a purely
defence viewpoint I do not think that there is anything in the report to worry us.
There does not appear to be a landing as such since the wheat is only depressed.
(not completely flattened) there are no tracks in the wheat and there does not
appear to be burn or scorch marks which could indicate that some type of combustion
engine. Furthermore there has been no evidence of any unusual sightings 1n the
are Just before the depressiuns were discovered.

3, Nevertheless something unusual has oeuurred; I lean to some kind of natural
phenomena such as minitornedoes bouncing off the ground. However, the theory does
not account for the regular configuration - perhaps the most unusual feature.
