b. Assuming, as I hope, that the Ministry of Defence does not
ignore the reports reaching it (and we have been told in
reply to Parliamentary questions that they amount to some
hundreds a year from civilian sources alone), what steps
are taken by the Department to investigate them? In par—
ticulerz— _

i) Are they dealt with solely ad hoc, using rautine staff
channels? or is there some Specialist group, either
within the Whitehall establishment or elsewhere, which
is charged with taking an expert view? If so, to whom
do they report? And what is their compositioh? DD
they include civilian advisers from Outside ybur

u Department?

ii) What part is played, if any, by the Flying Complaints
Flight at RAF Rudlue Manor? ‘

 

iii) What part, iF any, is played by Air Staff Secretariats
2 & B?

. c. ' How many of the reports of unusual phenomena have been re-
; ceived from Defence establishments, including reports From
the pilots of military aircraft?

 

o.

d. What material does your Department have of traces left on
military radar or in photographic form either From sorties
by military aircraft or from ground—besed or ship—based
facilities?

e. Can any such material be released either to me Dr to re-
Sponeible persons outside your Department for purposes of
scientific study?

In troubling you with these questions I am well aware that
their subject matter has often been thought easy to ridicule,
. A u especially when associated with seme of the wilder notions which are
- -§ current among the civilian research groups. I am not wedded to any
particular theory myself. I do, on the other hand, believe that
there is overwhelming evidence for a persistent phenomenon of a
highly unueual character. This is, at the least,ef considerable
F . scientific interest; and I have not yet heard anything from your
5 Department which convinces me that it is wholly without Defence
significance. I would be reassured to know either that it is being

adequately gripped as e Defence matter (and, if 50, by precisely
what means) or that material held by your Department can be released
