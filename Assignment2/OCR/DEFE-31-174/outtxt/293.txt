Spherical, approx 30-h0 feet diameter, with appearance of highly
polished silver metal, with a protruding lip § of the way from

the bottom, this being mid grey in colour. The lower surface of
this lip seemed to have a flat surface on the horizontal axis of the
sphere, the upper surface of the lip seemed concave and faired in.
The object emitted a throbbing double-beat sound somewhat akin to a
ship's propeller. The object became silent before it was out of the
audio range one would expect, as if the sound source had stopped.
