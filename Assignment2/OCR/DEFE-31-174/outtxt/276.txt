DIES With-

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

 

Reference:
A. D/US of S(AF)DGT 28/1/U dated 1 Aug 85
1. As you will see from Reference A (copy attached), Lord

Trefgarne has agreed to meet Lord Hill-Norton to discuss UFO'S.
Arrangements have been made for the meeting to take place on 25
September 1985 at 15.00 in the House. Sec(AS) will be represented at
the meeting and we see considerable advantage in having further
support from yourselves. Would you please let me know whether you
would be willing to attend.

2. We have drawn up the attached brief for US of S(AF) which
attempts to answer most of the questions posed by Lord Hill-Norton.
I should be grateful for your comments on these and, particularly,
for guidance from GE3 on how we might respond to question (d). The
answer to question (e) may also require some alteration depending on
the answer to question (d).

3. In addition to the attached brief we believe it would be
helpful to provide Lord Trefgarne with a speaking note desoribing
exactly how the MOD handles UFO reports. Provided you are oontent,
this will include a summary of the interests of GE3 and D155 and
would presumably need to be at least CONFIDENTIAL because of the
Tech-Int aspects. I should be grateful to know if you are content
for Lord Hill—Norton to be briefed in this way, and would be grateful
for short contributions desoribing your own areas of interest.

M. May I please have your replies by cop 30 August 85.

 

Sec(AS)23
