Thank ynu for your letter of 17th July about our corres-
pondence on the UFO question. I wnuld greatly welcome an off—the-
record talk with you. Parliament rises on Tuesday, but I would be
delighted to come up to London at any mutually convenient date
during‘ﬁugust when you have had time tn consider this letter and to
take ahy further briefing from officials which you think might be
useful. {Perhaps your office wauld care to be in touch with me by

telephone at my home address Tel: SeCﬂ0n4O

It may be helpful if I list the questions which I, at any
rate, would like to explore. I know you will understand that I do
not ask them frivpluqsly or without a good deal of careful thought
ab0ut the evidence — 0r supposed evidence — which appears to exist
for a persistent phenomenon whichI as I see it at present, cannot
be wholly without Defence significance. I need hardly add that if
there were sensitive Defence nuestions at iqsue, I weuld be the last
to press them in peblicl I '

The ground which I hcpe we might cover in an informal :
discussion is indicated'by the followihq questions: '

a. Does the Ministry of Defence acknowledge - by way of reports
from the public, the civil police, the Civil Aviation
Authority, other civil autherities.or its own establish-
ments - thet traces are obtained from time_to_time of the
intrusion into British airspace (and sometimes territory)
of phenomena for which no prosaiefexplanetioh can be given?‘
(I should add that although I am always willing to be dis—
uaded,_the evidence accumulated by civilian researchers for
the persistence of some such phenomena — amounting on
occasion to apparently structured 'vehicles' - seems to me
at present overwhelming. I shall be glad to give you-
instances. The events reported by Lt. Col. - the
United States Air'Foree in a report to yourmnt
dated 13th January 1981 are among them).
