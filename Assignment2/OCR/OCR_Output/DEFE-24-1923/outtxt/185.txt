f the 16th ?eb. I985 I crossed our farmyard and

p at the sky as it was so clear and the stars were
very bright, the first time for several weeks. Although I em not.
familiar with the positions and names of stars, one very hrlght llght

to the west caught my attention. It appeared about 51x tlmes large?
then the brightest constellation that night and seemea to hover as 1?
dangling from a string. About every five minutes the intensity of llght
increased and a red glow at the base seemed to increase. The green rays
on either side seemed more aefinite. After two minutes the light would

decrease an& the colours fade.

On the night 0
happened to look u

I called my husband, who was quite sceptical until he watched it
for a few minutes. He sai& it could only be a hotaair balloen and the
periodic red glow was the gas. I pointed out that there was quite a lot
of wind and I did not see how a hotaair balloon could remain fairly
stationery for such a long period. we debated the various possibilities
and came to the conclusion that we were witnessing one of the mysterious
UFO's we had previously ridiculed.

I first syotted it at 8.IOpm and continued to observe it until 8.h5pm.
At this time it seemed to move furthe away, ﬁne west and then sudaenly
accelerated at a high speed, gaining heght until it became ﬂgint and
finally disappearea. This sudden move took place over a period of
about 1% minutes.

I then phoned the Air base at Aberporth and spoke to the constable
on duty. He phoned me back later to say there had been no other reports
of such a sighting ané there was no possibility of it being a hotmair
balloon or a helicopter. The weather conditions were clear so it
could not he eénfused with inblement weather conditions. The lack of
other sightings could be put down to the fact that it was a bitterly
cold night with subvzero temperatures and few people were venturing out.
We only happenea to see it as we had to cross the yard,to the she&
where we were lembing’at frequent intervals.

The following night I looked for it again and observe& it at 7pm.
It was in the west and the light did not vary in intensity as on the
previous night. The red glow at the base and green on either side
were still visible. I did not call neighbours as I expectea it to
disappear before they coula get here and they night have aoubted my
credibility baa they arrived to find it gone. Irmovea very slowly
across the sky towards the north, sinking lower on the horizon. It
'eventually became redder and disappeared over the horizon at 9.50pm.
I rang the nearest neighbours at 9.30pm but they could not see it as
it had sunk toelow on the horizon to be visible from their place.
I reported it to Aberporth but once more they said they had not observe&
it. Our farm lies at an altitude of 650 ft in rolling hills where
the visibility varies éonsiderably between eifferent farms. The colour

was more intense than that from a plane and a larger 9? area of
surrounding sky was lit up by it than from the lights of a plane.
