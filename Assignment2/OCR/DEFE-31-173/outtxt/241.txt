up above the trees in my back.3arden that was flashing.blue,.white,

green and pink and it seemed to have things flashing off it. I called
my friend out to show her. We both stood and watched for about 5—10
minutes. I ran out to tell my neighbours but saw two young boys walking
by and asked them if they could see it they Said they could. I ran

back into my friend, we watched a little longer. I then ran next door
and told them, we went in their garden. They also saw it and the light
flashing off it. I ran back in again and my friend and I stood watching
it when a blinding white ball with a trail behind went above from left

to right, we both screamed at the Same time our neighbours heard use

The light at this time was going further back in the sky and throughout
the whole time the object was moving very fast and very erratic the

whole time. I am_not a nutter. I 'phoned the police who sent three
officers round, who all witnessed and agreed this was not a plane or a
star and that it was flashing colours ehd moving very erratic. This
object was also viewed thTOugh binoculars by the poliCe and myself”.
