t-'-1 531111110131: My Lords, may I ask the nobie
Visf'" ,11t 1111011111 the present Government adhere to
the view of the predeus Gmet'nntent which I put
forwaul when I reniietl to 1111: 1111111111: three years ago
in your Lordships’ I-tousc, that most 01‘ these so-culled
sightings can be accounted for :15: natural phenomena?

Viscount Long: Yes, my Lords, they Cﬂll be. Many
of them are accounted for in (1111: way 01' another
but nobody has got a really Const1 ncttve 1111311131 tor
1111 of them.

reports received by the Ministry of Defence before

be of no interest”? And if it is true, who was it
who decided 111111 they were of :10 interest?

Viscount Lung: My Lords, my reply to the noble

NII‘. Anatoly Shchttt‘attsky: Regresenmtions

Lord Rentoa: My Lords, I beg 1111111 to ask the
Question which stands in my name on the Order
P11.per

The Question was as follows:

To ask 111:1 Majesty‘s GOVernment whether they
are aware that Anatoly Shehaiansky has for the past
15 1110111115 been undernourished, tortured and
frequently placed 1n punishment ceils, and in October
1981 had his prison sentence 1111111111211 by 3 years
for his refusai‘to plead guiity 10 :1 charge 01‘11'1111311
he has always maintained his innocence; 11111.1 whether
they 11'i11 request the Soviet Govcrmnent to state
whether they intend to keep him in these nneiviiiscd
conditions until he reients or dies.

Lord 'l't'efgai'ne: My Lords. Her Majesty‘s Govern-
ment remain gravely concerned 21110111 the ptight 01‘
Anately Shehuransky and are disturbed by recent
reports 011115 iii—ti'czztment. We have raised this case

'11'1111 the Soviet authorities on many occasions, [10111

meeting: We 5111111 continue to take :1 010.11.- interest
in 1111'. Shcharanshy‘s case, and to make representations
as 51111111111: opportunities arise.

Lord Renton: My Lords, may I thank my noble
friend not only 1012111111 Answer but 1111' the action
which he :mcl.the 17011111111 Otiiee have been and 111-1.:
taking with regard to Shcharansky‘s 111113111? May I
ask my 1101351: friend 11'11ether 01' net 1111: Soviet Govern—
ment’s'faihn'e, as shown by the treatment ol‘Shcharan-
sky and others, to honour their Helsinki undertakings
diminishes their credibility in relation to 1111 other
matters in which they say they are seeking agreement
and on which they would like to be beiievecl?

1.0111 Trcfgarne: “‘1 may say so, my Lords, my
noble friend has put his ﬁnger on the 11:11) 011111: pt‘o-
b10111. 1-'Io11r can we bclich what they say 111 negotia-
tions such as the 11‘1'11 negotiations, the MB! R
negotiations 1151 they are c1111e11 in Vienna, 01' in any
other forum for that matter, when they (10 not do
what they said they would do at Helsinki in 1976?

Lord 81111111911: My Lords, in view 01‘ the rumours,
which are probabiy 11'e11 Founded, that 1111'. Brezhnev
is 111311111 to retire, coutd a message from your 1.11111—
ships‘ House he sent 10111111 through the Soviet 13111bassy
wishing him for 1111': remainder of his 11111—411111 we hope
he has many years left yet—-- peace 111111 contentment
and as. 111g 111111111111, as a guteious act 1112011 his retire-
ment, he will ensure that h-‘li. Shcharunsky 1:; 111:11te1'1as
a eiviiiseti person?

Lord 'I‘rei'garne: My Lords, 1 would certainly he 11111—
1113 to send another message to the Soviet Union about
Mr. Sheimranshy if! thought it would have any effect.
As to the future of Mr. Brezhnev, 1 believe that 111111 is
11 matter for them to decide for themselves.

Viscetmt P-‘Ieuntgarret: My Lords, would it 1101. help
11‘ the western 1111110113 ceased providing wheat to the
Soviet Union, at a time when they are ﬁnding them-
seres short, 1111111 they cease to carry out such inhuman
activities against individuals and sovereign States?

Lord Tret'garne: My Lords,the failure 01' the Soviet
agi'ieutttnal industry is now plain for 1111 to see, but 1
am not sure that the interests of the West are served

. by starving them out.

Len! Elwyn—Jones: My 1.01115, in view of the fact
that the treatment of Shcharansky seems to he _11
serious violation of 11111111111 rights, has; the matter
been raised before the sub-eommission 011 human'
rights at the United Nations?

_Lurd 'I‘refgarne: My Lords, I am not certain that
the matter 11:15 been raised 11:1'01'3 that 11111111111111" body
but certainly it has been raised before 1111 the others [
