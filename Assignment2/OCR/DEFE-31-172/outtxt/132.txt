been strange things to see in the sky, and strange explanations
'have been given. Since World War II we have seen development
of powerful rockets, and voyages to the Moon and planets. We
.have also seen the development of-ecience fiction, where space
ships can be switched to '1nter-stellar drive' and our here can
23;; the 2M light years to Andromeda Galaxf in a flash. We have
also seen the deveiopment of ufology and the UFO industryJWhich
accepts the delightful fantasies of science fiction as proven fact
and interpretathe phenomena in our skies aeeﬂien space craft. Mbst
of the phenomena are seen unexpectedly and very briefly, and are gone
before the eye has focussed. The words 'UFO' and 'space craft' have
been firmly implanted and too readiiy spring to mind.
