OPS (GE 0 *‘I ‘
Placed Opposite is a draft closing address fer the Lords

debate on UFOs, and a Backgroﬁnd Note; due at your office by

12 Januarx_lg1g.

2. There is a temptation to equivecate about UFOs because of

the thought that we might one day make contact with people from
distant stars. However, there is nothing to indicate that

ufology is anything but claptrap and no evidehce at all of 'alien
space craft'. The UFO industry hes prospered from equivocation and,
with 1979 being heralded as ’the year of the UFOs', it seems very
proper for HMG to injeCt some massive common sense into the business
and come out with an equivocal attack on ufology. -With the impact of
the film "Close Eneounters of the Third Kind", and the increasing
efforts of the UFO industry and increasing publicity given to its
exponents, quite sensible people may begin to wonder whether there
might not be something in urology, on the "where there‘s smoke there‘s
fire" principle. Less sensible people may be increasingly confused
and perhaps even worried, to the increasing profit and encouragement
of the UFO industry. The subject will not go away, the Department
and probably Ministers are likely to find themselves increasingly
involved and under pressure for formal statements; and the popular
and UFO press are likely to make all the mileage they can out of the
Lords Debate, particularly if thefe are signs of equivocation or
phrases that can easily be misrepresented.

4. Accﬂrdingly it is strohgly recommended that the Government take

an unequivocal and uncompromising line.
