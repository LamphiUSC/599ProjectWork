1. At_Reference ou sought advice from GE 3 to assist with your
response to: from the "official British Branch of Contact

International (for Humberside).“ GE 3 has passed our re uest to me
for action. Whilst I have no way of verifying H
credentials, nor even wish to as they sound mil y pornographic, and

therefore am unable to determine if he should be paseed details of
the aircraft operating from RAF Wyton, I believe that there is a
simple unclassified way to supply information on the airspace
Structure around wyton.

2e Most of the information requested by— is clearly
shown on a Royal Air Force Flight Information Publicatien entitled
En Route Low Altitude — British Isles South" (Chart code numbered
4128—L) which can be purchased from No l Aeronautical Information
Bocumentation Unit (No l AIDU) at RAF Northolt. A legend,explaining
the symbology used on the chart is also available. Both documents
are unclassified and readily available (at a cost). Further
information, if required, can be thained from DC No l AXDU at
Northolt (Ext 212}.

3. I hope this information will be of use in the preparation of
your response.
