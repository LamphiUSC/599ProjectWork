Thank you for your letter, undated, but which we received in
December. I apologise for not replying sooner.

During 1985 the Ministry of Defence received 160 reported
sightings of aerial phenomena or "UFOs", the majority of these
sightings being in the Welsh, Yorkshire and Thames Valley/London
areas.

To date in 1986 we have received 39 reports. I hope this
information is of some use to you and it is not too late for your
report.

Yours sincerely
