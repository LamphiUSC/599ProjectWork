A SECRET PRoéERTY - Page 1 of extract

Yet the phenomenon is undaubtedly under study in at least some back rooms...
That air of governmental indifference Eg an assumed one...

From documents released under the Freedom of Information Act in America we
have undeniable evidence of a keen interest in the phenomenon on the part of the
CIA, the National Security Agency, and other government departments. The facts are
meticulously documented in a recent book, CLEAR INTENT by Lawrence Fawcett and
Barry J. Greenwoad (Prentice~ﬂall, 1984). We know *hat the French government remains
interested: GEPAN continues in existence despite ggngeing cuts imposed on many
departments by the Mitterand gevernment a little while ago (though we can only
speculate on what use is made of its material by its directing body, the French
equivalent of NASA). We know that the Russian Academy of Sciences regularly buys
a surprising number of each issue of the most prestigious British journal on the
UFO phenomenon (though its importation by ordinary Soviet citizens is forbidden 2).
We must strongly suspect — to put it no higher ~ that the British Ministry of Defence
is taking a close interest in the phenomenon. As a former Ministry of Defence officia
I sincerely hope so ! Anything which can enter and leave British airspace with
impunity, land on British territory, leave confusing tracas in our radar system,
interfere with electrical and electronic devices, register itself on film and
out~manoeuvre British aircraft (and I think there is evidence for all these things)
must surely be of more than passing interest to a government department which is
charged with Our defence. I hope I shall be thought to compliment rather than criti—
Cise my former colleagues and present acquaintances in Whitehall if I ruefully
congratulate them on the suave effrontery with which they pretend to be taking no
notice of the stranger occurrences reported to them !
