The Flying ﬁomglaints Flight at Rudloe Manor are concerneﬁ
with receiving and investigating flying complaints. In the course of
their duties they occasienally receive UFO reports (as do many ether

units) but they have no specific role wiﬁh regard to this subject.

Secretariat {Air Staff) is the Diviaion which provides
secretariat support t0 CAS and the Air Staff and in this capacity is
reSpensible for correspondence with gembers of the public and
answering PQS etc on many subjects, including UFO'S. SecCASJZ is the
branch which amongst other things handles UFQ‘S, there is no such
branch as Air Staff Secretariat 8. You may be thinking of Defence

Secretariat 8 which no longer exists and from which Sec{AS} evolved

as a re$u1t of reorganisaﬁion 0f HOD last Jaguary.

c. ﬁany of the UFO reports receiveﬂ in MG? come through Defence
establishments, although most of these came eriginally from members
of the public. Very few reports are made %y military pilots; far
