The Air Force file copy had been properly disposed of in accordance with
Air Force Regulations. Fortunately, through diligent inquiry and the gracious
consent of Her Majesty’s government, the British Ministry of Defence and
the Royat Air Force, the US Air Force was provided a copy for yeu.

The January 13 letter was enciosed with C01. Bent’s response. It was on
the ofﬁcial letterhead of the Slst Combat Support. Group at Bentwaters and
signed by Lt. Col. Halt, who was the Deputy Base Commander. The title
of the document is “Unexplained Lights,” and it reads like science ﬁction:

1. Early in the morning of 27 Dec 80 (approximately OSOOL), two USAF
security potice patrolman saw unusual tights outside the back gate at RAF
Woodbridge. Thinking an aircraft might have crashed or been forced down,
they catied for permission to go outside the gate to investigate. The on-
duty ﬂight chief responded and allowed three patroimen to proceed on
foot. The individuais reported seeing a strange glowing object in the forest.
The obiect was described as being metaltic in appearance and triangular
in shape, approximatety two to three meters across the base and approxi-
matety two meters high. it illuminated the entire forest with a white tight.
The object itself had a putsating red tight on top with a bank(s) of blue
tights underneath. The object was hovering or on tegs. As the patrolman
approached the object. it maneuvered through the trees and disappeared.
At this time the animals on a nearby farm went into a frenzy. The obiect
was briefly sighted approximately an hour later near the back gate.

2. The next day, three depressions 11/2" deep and 7” in diameter were
found where the obiect had been sighted on the ground. The following
night (29 Dec 80) the area was checked for radiation. Betalgamma readings
of 0.1 miltiroentgens were recorded with peak readings in the three depres—
sions and near the center of the triangle formed by the depressions. A
nearby tree had moderate (.05».07) readings on the side of the tree toward
the depressions.

3. Later in the night a red sun—like tight was seen through the trees. 1:
moved about and pulsed. At one point it appeared to throw off giowing
partictes and then broke into ﬁve separate white objects and then disap~
peered. Immediately thereafter, three star-iike objects were noticed in the
sky, two obiects to the north and one to the south, alt of which were about
10° oft the horizon. The objects moved rapidly in sharp angular movements
and displayed red, green and blue tights. The obiects to the north appeared
to be elliptical through an 8—12 power tens. They then turned to full circtes.
The objects to the north remained in the sky for an hour or more. The
object to the south was visible for two or three hours and beamed down
a stream of light from time to time. Numerous individuals. including the
undersigned. witnessed the activities in paragraphs 2 and 3.

Outside of some small variation in detail, the story in the document is amaz-
ingly similar to what Art Wallace described. This ietter was certainly part
of a more detailed ﬁle, since it is clear that an ofﬁcial investigation was
conducted. Looking back at Colt Cochran’s April 28 reSponse to our inquiry
on Rendiesham, we now see that it amounts to nothing more than a gross
