group of Scandinavian scientists were
returning by air after observing an eclipse
of the sun from the poiar regions» They
were on their way back, but still taking
photographs of the sun. when :hcir atten‘
tion was taken by something else. chcraf
shining disc-hke objects appeared to be
shadowing their aircraft. What they ware,
none of the scientists knew They were
no aircraft such as us know them and
none of the scientists 0n the trip had ever
scan anything like them

And this year there have been a whole
spate 0f sighting reports. One private re-
searcher has connected 149 reports from
Great Britain for the months of April and
March alonc. No doubt many of these
could be discounted if a thorough inves—
tigation were made. But others remain
a mystery.

Before any of these can be truly IabeHcd
" unidentified,“ however‘ a very thorough
investigation must be made. The would-
bc investigator wauld have: :0 know,
among other (hangs. the movements of
3” aircraft or balioons hkcly to have been
in the area a: the time. He woufd have
to havc a very sound knowledge of
weather phenomena and astronomywand
of human nature.

But there are peopic wiiéing to under—
take this task To ﬁnd out whothcy arc
and how they go about the job, it is
necessary once more to dip brieﬂy back
into saucer history.

In the: early years soon after I947,
“saucer" clubs began to spring up all
(Wcr the country Their objects were not
aiways we}! deﬁned but gencraily it was
to investigate saucer sightmga.

Since this time there has been a
general mcvemtznt thwards amalgamation
and most clubs now rcguﬁarly exchange
views. with others in this country and
abroad. At the hub of a” saucer activi-
ties in this country is the magazine‘
Flying Sunrer Review.

Trench admits that
he is working on a
"sticky wicket." Ht:
realises that many of
his readers wan: to
.me “astounding sau~
ccr news “ but, at the
same time. he tries to
kecp reports 0f actual
sightings as objective
as possible. V
Among his readers
' are some wha act as
investigators. These
men Trench entrusts
with the task of looking into sightingst
Two su’ch men are Jack Ibsnu. a York-
shire business man. and Wiifred Danicis.
a technical writer from Stahord.
v These two, him most other 0! Trench‘s
investigators, are enthusiastic about their
task and bchcx'c implicitly in Flying
Saucers. They aim believe: that they haw
an inwrplanctary origin. How far is this
theory justiﬁed? Let Trench cxpiain:
“UFOs have been timed," he says.
"travelling at fantastic BpL‘cds. far in
excess of anything carthmadc. And.
again. many UFOs have been seen per-
forming manoeuvres, such as a right-
angled turn at high speed. which would
cause any normal material 0: crew to
disintegrats under the exccssive g loads.”
Prominent expéns. such as Professor
Hermann Oberth. the guided missiles
expert have also expressed these views.
Oberth says: “ My own explanation of
UFOs is thar they are machmex bum in
some pfacc other than on the Earth, I
bch'eve that they originate cxciusively
from outside the Earth because observa«
tions suggest that Flying Saucers are abie
to suppress the force of gramty~ and 1 do
not think that anyone on Earrh has yet
found the means to do so."

A typical report received by Trench is
that which came from Miss K. Connor.
3 member of the Royai Observer Corps,
whc fives; at Trum, Cornwall. Last
October. while: on 3 ROC exercise. Miss
Connor and her crew saw a UFO.

“ The_objcct appeared as a san, siivcr
round one: Iikc: a bah," said Miss (Tanner
in her report. “ Then it turned sideways
and was seen to be ohiongt ”ﬂu: side

Gravity Theary

In I950 Thornton wrote a thesis cn-
titled “ The Uniﬁed Field Theory “ which
dealt with many aspects of gravity which
had never before bcen examined. This
had a grgat success and is stiH used in
many universities all
students in (his ﬁeld at research. It was
in X950. too, that he ﬁrst became Smar-
cstcd in UFOst " Many aspects of this
phenomenont“ he says. "have a very
close hearing to my work on gravity,"

His ﬁrst dah’ing into thc {iteraturc
written on the subject of UFO: was not
encouraging. He still has no hesitation
in describing a!) of it as " science ﬁction.”
He makes one exception. This is the
hook “ The Report on Unidentiﬁed Flying
Objects." by Edward Ruppch, one~timc
head of the USAF “ Project 81115—8001; "

Dr. Thommn has also found out that
UFOs have a periodic frequency and that
séghtings reach a peak every 25 years. It
was in early March that he told me that
we could expect a crap of sightings to-

of mpmts has shown how right h: was.
