phnning to feature the comet on television specials for
syndication,although they do not want their names disclosed
yet. The TV networks and print media are expected to devote
considerable time to the comet. This will mark the first”
time that TV coverage Will be possihb. Looking at all the
multi—media coverageas indirect public relations for its
project, one of the syndicators has developed a logo for its
program_and has begun lining up‘lieeneees in the United

‘Tuttle, and a warning that it might collide with the earth.

Yet again it missed us by a million miles. The warning

was put out by Dr. Brian Marsden, of the Smithéonian Astro—
nomical Observatory in Massachuesets. He calculated the oaae
at l in 2 million of a collision. They are greater odds
than the annual chances of a disasterkfrom random astronomi—
cal events, such as a collision with an asteroid or a nearby
stellar exploeiOn. If Swift Tuttle had hit land the effect

would be far greater than theﬁlargest nuclear weapon. It

, Already once this century, in 1908 the earth has been
'etruek by a comet. But it occurred in a remote region of Sib»
'eria. Frightful.devaetati0n was caused, hut there were no inr
gjuries. Some reeeamehere-think this comet radiated radiation
iand traces ere found 100 years later. Some even think it was

fit was under guidance on the way down. Nb proof has yet been
jfound. Swift—Tuttle'comet_however was first seen in 1862,
