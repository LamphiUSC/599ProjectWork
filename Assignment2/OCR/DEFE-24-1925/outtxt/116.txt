Overall, we believe that the fact that Col Halt did nat repert
these occurrences to MOD for almoat 2 weéks after the event, tegether
with the relatively 19w key manner in which he handled the matter
{given resources available to him5 are indicative of the degree sf
importance in defence terms which should be attached to the incident.
He himself took all investigative action which was required. If
members cf the public feel that for scientific or other reasona,
there should be an attempt to establish the cause of what happened,
that is for them, but I am cdnfident that it is not asmething in

which the ﬁOD should or need become further involved.
