A. D/US of S(AF)ﬁGE ES/T/A dated i Aug 85

1. You asked at Reference A for briefing for Lord Trefgarne‘s
meeting with Lord Hillcﬂorton 0n 2 Octeber. I attach a piace
covering the questions paged by Lord Hillmﬁarton 13 his letter 6? 26
July. I believe this adequately covers the broader issues and I see
no need for further background briefing. chever I atﬁach a spscific
piece on the "RAF Woodbridge/Bentwaters” incident in which Lord Hill~
ﬁarton has previously shown an interest.

2. I would suggest that Minister is supported at the mgeting hy
Ed of 8ec(AS) ahd representatives of D Air Def and DSTI. I would
also like to attend myself if you have no objection. I understand
that Minister will wish to run through the brief pricr t0 the meeting
itself and that we should therefore meet at i4.30 on Wedneﬁday 2 Oct.
I shauld be grateful if you would let us know the venue in ﬁne
ccurseo
