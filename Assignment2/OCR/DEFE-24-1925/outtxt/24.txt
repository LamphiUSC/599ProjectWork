The table is supported on an h@misphericai pivoting

After 1.1m “bar” or “scan” stops at the end of the

They answm“: “Sit there for a while,” john is sui-

what they said. Whereupon he sits up and swings his
legs over the side of the table. His legs fee! weak and
his whole body feels very 10056. To his amazement he

A recent drawing by Elaine of the “examiner" ~
no feet could be seen. This is the nearest she can
achieve of this horriﬁc-looking being

20ft. long, 12ft. wide, and 7~8ft. high. It is oval in
shape, both horizontally and vertically. There are no
seams in either wall or ceiling, and everything is
perfectly smooth iikc the inside of a bubble. There
appears to be no furniture other than the table and
the two lights above him.
