I am writing to acknowledge your letter of 2 October 1985 in which yau refer to
a law Flying aircraft passing over the village of Almundbury an 19 September
1985.

I have to tell you that I have no knowledge of such an aircraft muvement however,
yuu will be aware that aircraft and helicopters regularly overfly Yurkshire at
relatively low altitude. As you may be aware thare are no jet aircraft or
helicopters permanently based at RAF Leaming at present and ynu will therefore
understand that I have no direct contrul over the aircraft involved in this
incident, nu: any aircraft operating in your area.

In reply to your enquiry regarding aircraft lighting I regret that I am unable
ta assist you other than to stata that must aircraft carry red and green
navigation lights, red Flashing anti—cmllisiun lights and, in some cases,
flashing white strobe lights.

I regret that I am unable to assist you further in this matter and would suggest,
as Royal Air Farce Leaming's invulvemant in aviation within Yorkshire is at
