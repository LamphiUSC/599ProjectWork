UFOs - RECORDS HELD BY PRO — ENQUIRY FROM MR R NOYES

1. I attaoh a copy of a letter I have received from a Mr Ralph
Noyes concerning UFO's. I also enelose a oOpy of my reply. Mr Noyes

is an ex Head of D38 and retired from the MOD as an AUS in the late
seventies, he is a regular QOTTESpOﬁdent on UFO matters and, because
of his baokground, is quite influential in ”UFO" oiroles.

2. As you will see, he raises two points on which I should be
grateful for your advice. The first concerns 2 reports which he
claims to have obtained from the Publie Reoords Offiee. In view of
our often repeated assertion that our reoords only go baek to 1962 (a
line which I believe you have confirmed in the past) this oould
olearly become slightly embarrassing. I therefore feel that we
ShOUld try to identify exactly what files PRO still hold on the
subject and perhaps you oould suggest the best way of doing this. In
the meantime I propose to take the same line with other oorres—
pondents as I have in the attaohed.

3. Mr Noyes' second point is a request for information relating,
I assume, to events in 1956. If he was shown photographs in 1970 as
he olaims it may be that these files have also been retained. I have

told him that we would need further information in order to identify
these inoidehts but I am sure that more details will be forthcoming.
However, if you are able to shed any light on the "olips", or indeed,
the ihoidehts themselves at this stage, I would be most interested to
know.
