IS Day I985

 

 

Thank you for your letters of 24 February and 23 Darch I985;
I 33 sorry that I Ixave been unable to reply before now. I regret
that the Department coul3 not jI stify the expenditure in terms of

him 3n3 effort whic CD would be equire D3 to collate information 3n
reports of UFO‘S in the Dyfed area since 197?. *

You may find it useful if I explain that the sole interest of
the ”niDed Kingdcm Ministry of Defence in reporteds ghtings 3f
Unﬁd entified Flying Objects (D I 3) is to establish whetner they have
any bearing on the defence of the country.

:4

There is no Grganisatien in the Ministry of Defence appainted
soIer for the purpose of studying reports of such objects, and no
3D3ff are employed 0n the subject full tirae fhe reports we receive
3re referred to the sDaff in the Department who are responsible for
Dha air Gefence 3f the Unite3 Kingdom, and they examine the raportg

33 part of their normaI duties.

Since our inlere3t in UFOs is limited to possib13 defence
impiioations we have not carriad out 3 study into the scientific
Significance of thege phenomena. Unless there are defence
Implications we do not aztempt Do ’ e ntify Sightings and we cannoh
inform observe rs 9f the probabi' i3ent ity of the object seen. The
