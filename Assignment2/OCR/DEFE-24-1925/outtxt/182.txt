ABOUT UFO'S

.The truth is I can't find any branch of the subject to get
Zenthusiastio over. Some points however then—one by one
ﬁtogehher with my responses.

Ql. NEXT 25 YEARS OF UFOLOGY?My answer to this is fairly simple,

: if not cynical. BUFORS'S subscriptions are going up

ti-- they

: rise and rise, until they are down to 150 hard core members.
?Most will be on so many different committees that they will be

All we see right now is the insane use of

E Military Strategy outside our atmosphere. Reality and science—

; fiction are becoming transposed, and neither Luke Skywalker or

Carl Saganioan tell one from the other. Science is a good tool,

; but a bad master. The days of science as a boon to Mankind are
} 0ver,if they ever existed beyond Pastuer or Fleming. Did Vbn
~ Braun know what he was doing? There are much worse things in

the‘world, far more obscene than bare t..s!? Science scares me.
It cannot be trusted any more than our petty, squabbling ‘lead-
