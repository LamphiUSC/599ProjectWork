POSSIBLE UFO ~ HEATHROW AIRPORT AREA

Thank you for your letter of 7 May 1986, addressed to Air Traffic Control.

I regret to say I am not able to help you. I have looked in the ATC log for

2 April 1986 but nothing untoward was reported, around noon or during that
day.

I have therefore forwarded your letter and contents to the Ministry of Defence
(AFO) Division 8 in London. That Department deals with reports on UFOs and if
you have any further information please send it to them at Main Building,
Whitehall SWIA 2H8.

Yours sincerely

for CAA Chief Officer
Heathrow Airport - London

A joint Civil Aviation Authority -— Ministry of Defence Service
