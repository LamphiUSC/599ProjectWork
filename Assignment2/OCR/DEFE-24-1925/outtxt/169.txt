DJ, continue ° When pressed, a Ministry spokesman told

me:

"We accept that reports were made byeﬂanea rational PeOPlSrH

A hundred people do not imagine they saw something.
'But no physical evidence was found that anything has happen
ned.

"We only investigate UFOs to find whether there is a threat
to our defences. -
”If there is no threat, that is the end of the matter. we
do not investigate whether UFOs exist or what causes them.”
Asked who decided there was no danger to highly sensitive
defence areass the spokesman added: "We are not prepared to

ﬁiscuss how we investigate.”
CNK SAKS: The reason for this is obvoius. THEY CAN'T INVEST—

‘being tested but for the last 25 years or so and (b) If the
UFO is of extraterrestrail origin, nu government on earth
has the yowerjto investigate such a device. Nations are
powerless aga1nst such craft. And because of this lack of
power to 1nvestigate, the public are given hogwash from

the MOD and other departments. It wouldn't be good pub—

lic relations would it, if the public knew that UFOs

CAN' T BE contrelled by the MOD or anybody else. That would
make them look WEAK in their eyes. This then may he the:”
theory behind why such anewers are given out by alI “L
governments, becauee they have no control over a ‘potential
enemy.‘ TRUE MOD?or what do you say to that? Or is the
broken record, erepainptt still- in operation?
