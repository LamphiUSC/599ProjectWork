a. I accept that there are strange phenomena to be seen in the
Skyg however I believe there to be adequate explanations for them.
Experience has shown that mast reported sightings can be attributed
to things such as aircraft, meteorological balloons or natural
phenomena like ball lightning" Of course there are many other
equally $traightforward explanations. However, there are a small
number of cases where a simple explanation cannot be found
immediately and on these occasions we are careful to ensure so far as
posgibla that that they are of no Defence significance, H&ving
satisfied aursélves of this, as you know, we do not attempt any
further investigation$. Clearly some reports remain unexplained but
we have found no evidence that these phenomena represent a threat to
national security and therefore cannoﬁ justify devoting Defence

resources to their investigation.
