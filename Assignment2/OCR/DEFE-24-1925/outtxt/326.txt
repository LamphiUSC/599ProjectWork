Dear Sir,’ , 7

. . - REDACTED ON ORIGINAL
%1th regards to the above nam . It has come to our attention
that on the 19th June 1980 a Miss observed a large spherical shaped object

heading out to sea at'a slow speed, The object was seen for several minutes to
display a pulsating red glow. The witness states the time was approximately 14.00.

REDACTED ON ORIGJNAL . ., .
w . . to laentlfy the subject lmage and therefore contacted the local

police at Scarborough. At approximately 3.50pm, some 90 minutes after observing
the phenomena, the witness was contacteﬁ by personnel at Fylingdales. They asked
numerous questions in relation to the purported sighting.

 

~wqéﬁﬁe would be grateful for a copy of the report held by your base. Einistry of Defence
opolicy is not to releasa 'UFO‘ reports due in the main for witness confiﬁentiality
purposes. However the witness requires no such assurance and therefore the non~
release of this report would perhaps indicate one potential. RAF Fylingdales has
the capability to track just about anything anywhere and one must pressume the
aévanced system used by your base raceived a return from this target?

We would be pleaSed to forward a detaileé copy of —report,any informat—
ion received will be used for research purposes only. Thank you for your time an&
we look forward to receiving your reply.
