‘\”JﬂITORIAL ;

It has been 22 years now since that
famous EEO sighting by Ken Ernaiﬁ,
and we are no closer to them today“

 

All we haVQ the power to do is stand

and stare in awed rapture at rain
sodden skies on skywatches, hopingf
something spectacular will happen,f
snap photographs, investigate other
pecple’s claims, spend public money
on projects like the Condom Report
which has apparently been controver-
sial to some, and print volumns of
literature, and read read read about
item for another 22 or more years.
