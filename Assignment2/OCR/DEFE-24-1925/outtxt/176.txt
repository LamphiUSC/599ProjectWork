‘rHoTo FILE ON THE Uwo RESEARCHERS AND HUNTERS:

Throughout the 60's and 1970's and maybe even today, UFO‘s have

‘ fasinated ordinary folk. Some have actually had encounters with
‘ them. In the few following pages, we reproduce some unpublished

photos of those who have spent many hours on this unrewarding
research:
