FLYING OBJECT \ »
At 14.10 hours on Wedne Sighting 28 November 1984, I attended at' Description
Otley and there 8 oke to

informed me that at about 14.25 hours on

Tuesday 27 November 1984 she was stood in the kitchen of
the above address looking out towards Otley Chevin, which
when she saw an object which she
describes as disc shape and spherical, and larger than a
distbin lid. No lights were displayed on the object and it
appeared to be moving under power as opposed to drifting
about in the sky.

exact post  ‘is to the South of Otley,  
 
 

I informed both ladies that to the best of my knowledge when
aircraft took off or landed from Yeadon Airport they cleared
The Chevin at approximately 500 feet, and I asked them if the
object was as high in the sky as this. —informed
me that it was lower.

How observed 

Whilst watching the object I was informed that the sun was
not shining, however, it appeared to them to be a dull grey
colour but when either the underside or topside was in view
it glinted with a metallic effect.

how observed

When the object was first since’it was to the South of Otley
and was below the skyline of Otley Chevin. VThe object then
travelled towards the North East, that is right across the
Wharfedale Valley in the direction of a small radio mast
situated near Almscliffe Crag. Whilst watching the object
they saw it turn round travel back across the valley in a
Southerly direction over ploughed fields in front of
Farnley Hall, and appeared to land in an area known as
Knotford Nook.

Both ladies did not actually see the object land as at this
point their view was obscured by trees. They then returned
' inside the houses ‘ ’

At 15.30 hours the same day, I spoke to the Air Traffic

. ”’“g Controller at Yeadon Airport, who informed me that at the

§ ‘ } time and on the date in question there was no aircraft

E a movement whatsoever from the Airport and no weather ballons
had been released at that time.

On instructions of Headquarters minute sheet dated 9 November
1967, I submit this report for the information of the Chief

the Ministry of Defence.
